# AnatomyOfAnIonTrap
plans for a demonstrator

## Advanced ion trap quantum processors...
...have a lot of cool stuff packed into a rather tiny space. They are multi-layerd assemblies of metallic and insulating structures on the micron scale.

## Do such things exist out in the world

Surprisingly I struggled to find much in the way of similar 3d printed microchip devices

## What to 3D print
There are options I think:

- a monolithic **semi-transparent block**, fairly accurately matching a real trap but scaled up and probably with some exaggerated feature sizes for visibility - durable
- **puzzle type assembly** that can be taken apart to explore the inside, and put back together - interactive
- **integrated LEDs** in a semi-hollow / cutaway, and a bank of buttons to light up certain features: trap RF, MW antenna, atomic oven, gradient coils, laser waveguide, readout detector, integrated electronics, even an ion on top maybe
- a fanned-open deconstructed set of layers (book-fold page-fan ...)

## Workflow

- Sussex team to convert real trap geometry files (.gds) over to blender format. 
- Send an early simple test over for 3D print test
- Revise the layout to add more interesting details and the active elements
